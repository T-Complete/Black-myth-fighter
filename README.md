This brunch is used to set up your python environment.I recommand you use Anaconda.if you have conda, use yml to create a new environment.
You can use this:conda env create -f environment.yml -n yourenvname

If you haven't got the conda,you can use pip to install them:pip install -r requirements.txt

Both two are right.
